# Simple-Zip-Cracker
Simple Python script that tries brute forcing the password and export the contens of the compressed archive. The program uses proccesses and, based on your computing process avilability, will calculate how many processes it can manage concurently.

# Basic Usage
Downlaod the provided `zip_cracker.py` file and run it. Alternitavly, you can use `git clone https://github.com/YuvalKoz/Simple-Zip-Cracker.git` in the terminal.
Make sure the compressd archive is saved on your system, and once prompted, input the location of the archive. The program will run and will either result with no match found, or it will give the password and extract the contents of the archive to the saem directory in a new file.

# Note:
